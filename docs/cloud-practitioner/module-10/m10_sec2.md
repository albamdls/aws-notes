# ‚öôÔ∏è **Module 10 - Automatic Scaling and Monitoring**  

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Section 2: Amazon CloudWatch**

### üü† **Introduction**

To maintain performance, cost control, and security in the cloud, you need **visibility** into how your systems are operating.  
**Amazon CloudWatch** provides real-time **monitoring**, **alerting**, and **automation** for AWS resources and applications.

CloudWatch collects and tracks **metrics**, collects **logs**, and enables **automated responses** to changes in your environment ‚Äî helping you operate efficiently and proactively.

---

### üìä **What Is Amazon CloudWatch?**

**Amazon CloudWatch** is a **monitoring and observability service** that provides data and actionable insights for:
- AWS resources (e.g., EC2, RDS, Lambda, EBS, S3).  
- On-premises systems and hybrid environments.  
- Applications and custom business metrics.  

It helps detect anomalies, optimize performance, and trigger automated actions when thresholds are breached.

üß† *Example:* Automatically add EC2 instances to handle traffic spikes or send an alert when CPU usage exceeds 80%.

### üß© **Core CloudWatch Components**

| **Component** | **Description** |
|----------------|-----------------|
| **Metrics** | Quantitative data points (e.g., CPU utilization, network I/O, request latency). |
| **Alarms** | Trigger notifications or actions based on metric thresholds. |
| **Logs** | Collect and analyze log data from AWS services and applications. |
| **Dashboards** | Custom visualizations for monitoring metrics in real time. |
| **Events (EventBridge)** | Respond to system changes automatically (e.g., trigger Lambda functions). |
| **Contributor Insights** | Identify top contributors to system performance issues. |
| **Anomaly Detection** | Uses ML to detect unusual behavior in metrics automatically. |

---

### üìà **CloudWatch Metrics**

Metrics are the **foundation** of CloudWatch monitoring.  
They measure the performance of AWS resources and are automatically collected for most services.

| **Metric Example** | **Service** | **Purpose** |
|----------------------|-------------|--------------|
| CPUUtilization | EC2 | Measures instance processor use. |
| Invocations | Lambda | Tracks number of function executions. |
| DatabaseConnections | RDS | Measures open connections to a database. |
| NetworkIn / NetworkOut | EC2, ELB | Monitors incoming and outgoing traffic. |
| ReadIOPS / WriteIOPS | EBS | Tracks disk read/write operations. |

üß† *Tip:* You can also **publish custom metrics** (e.g., number of users online, app latency).

---

### üö® **CloudWatch Alarms**

**Alarms** let you respond automatically when metrics breach predefined thresholds.

#### üí° **How They Work**
1. Define a **metric and threshold** (e.g., CPUUtilization > 75%).  
2. Specify an **evaluation period** (how long to wait before triggering).  
3. Choose an **action** ‚Äî send an alert (via SNS) or run an automation (e.g., scale resources).

#### ‚öôÔ∏è **Alarm States**
| **State** | **Meaning** |
|------------|-------------|
| **OK** | Metric is within the defined threshold. |
| **ALARM** | Metric has crossed the threshold. |
| **INSUFFICIENT_DATA** | Not enough data points to determine state. |

üß† *Example:* If average CPU > 80% for 5 minutes, CloudWatch triggers an SNS notification or Auto Scaling event.

---

### üìú **CloudWatch Logs**

**CloudWatch Logs** collect, store, and analyze logs from AWS services and custom applications.

#### üß∞ **Capabilities**
- Centralized **log aggregation** from multiple sources.  
- **Real-time log streaming** for analysis or dashboards.  
- Integration with **CloudWatch Logs Insights** for querying logs with SQL-like syntax.  
- Retention policies for automatic log deletion.  

üß† *Example:* Store EC2 system logs or Lambda execution logs for troubleshooting.

---

### üßÆ **CloudWatch Dashboards**

Create **custom dashboards** to visualize metrics and logs from multiple AWS accounts and Regions in one place.

#### **Key Benefits**
- Combine multiple metrics (e.g., CPU, memory, latency) on a single panel.  
- Share dashboards across teams.  
- Add alarms, charts, and annotations for context.  
- Use them for **operational visibility** and **executive reporting**.

üß† *Example:* A single dashboard shows EC2 instance health, Auto Scaling activity, and RDS performance metrics.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è **CloudWatch Events (Now Amazon EventBridge)**

**CloudWatch Events** (integrated into **Amazon EventBridge**) enable **event-driven automation**.

#### **Capabilities**
- Detects changes in AWS resources (e.g., EC2 state change, Lambda error).  
- Triggers actions automatically (e.g., invoke a Lambda, start a Step Function, or send an SNS notification).  
- Uses event patterns and rules to route events to targets.

üß† *Example:* When an EC2 instance stops unexpectedly, EventBridge triggers a Lambda function to restart it.

---

### ü§ñ **Automation and Integration**

**CloudWatch** integrates with other AWS services to automate responses and remediation.

| **Integration** | **Action** |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Auto Scaling** | Adjust instance capacity automatically based on metrics. |
| **AWS Lambda** | Execute custom automation code when an event occurs. |
| **Amazon SNS** | Send alerts via email, SMS, or to chatbots. |
| **AWS Systems Manager** | Run predefined automation playbooks for incident response. |

üß† *Example:* CloudWatch detects high latency ‚Üí triggers Lambda ‚Üí clears cache in ElastiCache cluster.

---

### üîê **Security and Access Control**

- Integrated with **AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)** for granular permissions.  
- Use **resource-level permissions** to restrict access to metrics and dashboards.  
- Encrypt logs using **AWS KMS**.  
- Use **cross-account dashboards** for centralized monitoring in multi-account environments.  

üß† *Best Practice:* Limit CloudWatch access to read-only roles for most users.
