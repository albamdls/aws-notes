# 🗃️ **Module 8 - Databases**  

## 4️⃣ **Section 4: Database Migration and Integration on AWS**

### 🟠 **Introduction**

Many organizations begin their cloud journey by migrating existing **on-premises databases** to AWS.  
AWS provides powerful, automated tools to simplify and accelerate this process — minimizing downtime, data loss, and manual effort.

This section explores the main AWS services for **database migration, integration, and modernization**.

### 🔁 **Why Migrate Databases to AWS**

| **Benefit** | **Description** |
|--------------|----------------|
| **Cost Savings** | Eliminate hardware costs and reduce maintenance overhead. |
| **Scalability** | Scale up or down easily to meet changing demands. |
| **High Availability** | Built-in Multi-AZ replication and automatic failover. |
| **Security** | Encryption, IAM, VPC, and compliance support. |
| **Automation** | AWS handles backups, patching, and monitoring. |
| **Innovation** | Integrate with analytics, AI/ML, and serverless architectures. |

🧠 *Tip:* Database migration is often the first step toward full cloud modernization.

### ⚙️ **AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS)**

**AWS Database Migration Service (DMS)** helps you **migrate databases quickly and securely** to AWS with minimal downtime.  
It supports both **homogeneous** and **heterogeneous** migrations.

#### 🔧 **How It Works**
1. Create a **source endpoint** (on-premises or cloud database).  
2. Create a **target endpoint** (e.g., Amazon RDS, Aurora, DynamoDB, or Redshift).  
3. Configure a **replication instance** to manage data movement.  
4. Run the migration task — either one-time or continuous replication.

#### 🧩 **Supported Database Engines**
- **Homogeneous migrations** (same engine):  
  - Example: Oracle → Oracle, MySQL → MySQL.  
- **Heterogeneous migrations** (different engines):  
  - Example: Oracle → Aurora, SQL Server → PostgreSQL.

#### ⚡ **Key Features**
- **Minimal downtime** — supports live replication while source remains online.  
- **Continuous data replication** for hybrid or multi-region setups.  
- **Supports all major commercial and open-source databases.**  
- **Monitored via Amazon CloudWatch.**

🧠 *Example:* Use DMS to continuously replicate data from an on-prem Oracle database to Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL until the final cutover.

### 🧰 **AWS Schema Conversion Tool (AWS SCT)**

**AWS Schema Conversion Tool (SCT)** complements DMS by converting database schema and code automatically between engines.

#### 🧩 **Capabilities**
- Converts database **schemas**, **functions**, **stored procedures**, and **views**.  
- Identifies **incompatible objects** and provides detailed conversion reports.  
- Supports migrations between major commercial and open-source engines.  
- Integrates with DMS for seamless end-to-end migration.  

🧠 *Example:* Convert an Oracle schema to PostgreSQL before using DMS to replicate live data.

### 🌐 **Database Modernization with AWS**

Migrating to AWS also allows you to **modernize** — not just move — your databases.

| **Legacy System** | **Modern AWS Alternative** | **Benefit** |
|--------------------|-----------------------------|--------------|
| Oracle / SQL Server | Amazon Aurora (MySQL/PostgreSQL compatible) | Lower cost, managed scaling. |
| On-prem MongoDB | Amazon DocumentDB | Managed, compatible, elastic. |
| Cassandra / Keyspaces | Amazon DynamoDB | Serverless, highly available. |
| On-prem caching servers | Amazon ElastiCache | Fully managed, microsecond latency. |
| On-prem analytics DB | Amazon Redshift | Scalable, petabyte-scale analytics. |

🧠 *Tip:* Modernization unlocks serverless, analytics, and global scalability capabilities.

### 🔗 **Integrating Databases with AWS Services**

Once migrated, databases can integrate seamlessly with other AWS services to build full-stack, intelligent applications.

| **Service** | **Integration Example** | **Purpose** |
|--------------|--------------------------|-------------|
| **AWS Lambda** | Trigger functions on database changes. | Event-driven automation. |
| **Amazon Kinesis** | Stream database updates in real time. | Real-time analytics and dashboards. |
| **Amazon S3** | Offload snapshots, exports, and logs. | Archival and cost optimization. |
| **Amazon Glue / Athena** | Query and transform stored data. | Serverless analytics and ETL. |
| **Amazon QuickSight** | Visualize and share insights. | Business intelligence. |

🧠 *Example:* Stream changes from DynamoDB to Kinesis and analyze them in real time with QuickSight.

### 🧭 **Migration Strategy Overview**

AWS recommends following a **phased approach** to database migration:

1. **Assess** – Evaluate current workloads, dependencies, and goals.  
2. **Mobilize** – Prepare migration plans, select target services, and define testing strategy.  
3. **Migrate and Modernize** – Move data using DMS and SCT; modernize where possible.  
4. **Optimize** – Review performance, cost, and scaling post-migration.  

🧠 *Tip:* Start small with a pilot migration, then scale up once patterns are established.

---

### 🔒 **Security and Compliance in Migration**

- **Encryption:** All data encrypted in transit (TLS) and at rest (KMS).  
- **IAM Roles:** Control who can create, manage, or access migration tasks.  
- **VPC Integration:** Migration traffic stays within private AWS networks.  
- **CloudTrail Auditing:** Logs all DMS activity and schema conversions.  
- **Compliance:** Supports HIPAA, SOC, PCI, GDPR, and more.  

🧠 *Best Practice:* Always encrypt replication endpoints and test failover procedures post-migration.

### 🧠 **Key Takeaways**

- **AWS DMS** enables **fast, secure, minimal-downtime migrations** for both homogeneous and heterogeneous databases.  
- **AWS SCT** automates schema and code conversions between engines.  
- Modernization enables better scalability, performance, and cost efficiency.  
- Integrate databases with services like **Lambda, Kinesis, Glue, and QuickSight** for intelligent workflows.  
- Follow AWS’s **Assess → Mobilize → Migrate → Optimize** strategy for successful cloud adoption.  
- Always enforce **encryption, IAM policies, and monitoring** for secure migrations.
