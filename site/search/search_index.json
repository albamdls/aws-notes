Security at the Edge Built-in network and application protection (e.g., AWS Shield Standard) and support for custom SSL/TLS certificates via AWS Certificate Manager. Highly Programmable Supports customization using Lambda@Edge, allowing you to run code close to users for improved responsiveness. Integrates with DevOps and CI/CD pipelines. Deep AWS Integration Seamlessly integrates with AWS services (like S3, EC2, and Elastic Load Balancing) and shares the same global network backbone. Cost-Effective No minimum fees or long-term commitments. You pay only for what you use.
